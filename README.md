Welcome to my corner of the digital world. Fey Valentine here—bounty hunter, hacker, master of escaping sticky situations. If you’re here to see my code, then you're in for a wild ride, because just like my bounty hunts, my coding style is a blend of calculated precision and total chaos. Think of this as a mission, one where the end game is always ahead of you.

## About Me

- 🏃‍♀️ **Current Focus:** Mastering code while staying one step ahead of anyone trying to track me. (And by “anyone,” I mean the law and the bad guys alike.)
- 💼 **Occupation:** Bounty hunter, con artist, code-breaker—sometimes all at once.
- 🌱 **Learning:** I'm always leveling up, diving into machine learning, staying sharp with tech, and refining my escape strategies (because you never know when you'll need one).
- 🔭 **Projects:** Whether it's web dev, algorithm deep-dives, or something totally out of the blue, I’m all about the challenge.
- 💬 **Ask me about:** JavaScript, Python, React, or how to leave a room without anyone noticing.
- 📫 **Contact:** [feyuwufey@gmail.com](mailto:feyuwufey@gmail.com)

## 💻 My Skills & Tools

I’m as deadly with code as I am with... well, anything that requires a quick getaway:

- **Languages:** JavaScript, Python, HTML/CSS, SQL (I code fast, no time for errors).
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** React, Node.js, Express, Flask, Django (gotta be prepared for anything).
- **Tools & Platforms:** Git, GitHub, Docker, AWS, Azure, Jenkins (it’s like the weapons in my tech arsenal).

## My Code Is My Bounty

Think of every repo here as a bounty waiting to be claimed. But don't expect an easy win—you’ll need skill, luck, and maybe a little charm to take something valuable. And just like any mission, things might get... messy.
